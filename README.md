# Welcome to my Java first coding!
Hi! I am Behnam, and I am starting to code in java. I want to share everything from the beginning.
I would be happy to add any comment on my coding in Java.
# Basics
First of all I would start with all the basics and go step by step until I compile my codes.
## Installing Java
First of all I have to install JDK which stands for Java Development Kit also known as Java SE. with this package my computer would be abale to compile and run java codes and programs. So as the first step I basically search for JDK or Java SE and download the latest version for free.

## Finding an appropriate code editor
Now I need a code editor to write my codes in java and then compile them.
I personally chose IntelliJ IDEA community. It is user friendly and powerful and it is free.

> ***Important tip***
I actually downloaded Java installer from the Princtone university educatonal website. which is embeded in [this link](https://lift.cs.princeton.edu/java/windows/)


# Frist Code
After opening the IntelliJ program, by opening a new project in java and some next click a coding page will open. On the right menu by right-clicking on the source and adding a Java class we can actually code in Java.  File code1.java is the first code here.
